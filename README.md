# ez-keylogger

This code is only for educational porpuses. Only test it in your own machine. You will go to prison if you use this code to harm and or stole information.

To use this keylogger you need to install pynput (I found this is a better module than pyhook because we don't need to install pywin32)

 - pip install pynput
